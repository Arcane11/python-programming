# Week 2 Materials README

You can find a schedule for Week 2, along with links to Google Slides decks for each lecture here:
> - [Week 2 Master Schedule + Lecture Slides Links](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNJu3GIJl_dLRzcdJyI83AHCCdADbZGpBuhwnzwFE8g/edit#gid=0)
> - [Lecture Slides Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h8DvTMuqDXUilISAY6XVxRnAWeuYPvbE?usp=sharing)

Each lecture will be a mix of slides and live coding in a Juptyer Notebook. Slides are still in-progress (too verbose currently, will be trimming them down), as are Jupyter Notebooks.

All content is subject to change based on how much the students get through in the first week.
