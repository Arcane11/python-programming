    "# Recap of Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **time complexity** refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time taken by an algorithm to run, **as a function of the size of the input to the program**. The time complexity is usually expressed in big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g., in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Time Complexity and Big-O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a few common examples to illustrate time complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constant Time: $O(1)$\n",
    "An algorithm is said to have a constant time when **it is not dependent on the input data size**. Whether your input data size is 1 or 1000 or 1 million, the time taken to compute the result is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_first_item(items):\n",
    "    return items[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above Python function, no matter how large the list items is, the function would take the same amount of time to get the first item in the list. This is thus $O(1)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Time: $O(n)$\n",
    "An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time **increases linearly** with the size of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def linear_search(items, target):\n",
    "  for i in range(len(items)):\n",
    "    if items[i] == target:\n",
    "      return i\n",
    "  return -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function above, in the worst-case scenario (if the target is at the end of the list or not in the list at all), the function will have to look at each item in the list once. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n)$, where n is the number of items in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quadratic Time: $O(n^2)$\n",
    "An algorithm is said to have a quadratic time complexity when the time execution is proportional to the square of the input size. A common example of this is the nested for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def bubble_sort(items):\n",
    "    n = len(items)\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n",
    "            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:\n",
    "                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bubble sort function above, for each item in the list, we're potentially looking at every other item in the list. As such, this gives us a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Important?\n",
    "Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing efficient code, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Poorly optimized code can take significantly longer to run, which can be problematic in real-world applications where performance is important.\n",
